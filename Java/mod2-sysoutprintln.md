# __Module 2: `System.out.println()`__
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)

## 1) What is System.out.println()
* System.out.println() is a piece of code that puts text on the browser console
* The console can be accessed by pressent `CTRL + SHIFT + J` or `CMD + SHIFT + J` depending on your operating system.
* Within the parentheses of System.out.println() you can put text surrounded by quotes ("")

Example
```Java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
Things to note:
* "System" always has a capital "S", but "out" and "println" are all lowercase
* Any text is always surrounded by double quotes
* **The code requires a semicolon (;) at the end of each statement to function properly**

## 2) Apply System.out.println()
### Activity 1: Hello World
* Put what you've learned within the __main method__ to make the console print "Hello World"
* Once you're done: Congrats! You've completed the symbolic first step of learning to code!

### Activity 2: Name and Favorite Activity
* Use two "System.out.println()" statements to write your name and your favorite activity
* Once you're done: This is the end of module 2. Follow the instructions given by your instructor for what to do next.

# Debugging
When your code doesn't work, you need to debug (pronounced de-bug) it! Follow the steps below to catch common mistakes
1. **Check Capitalization:** is "Console" capitalized? Is "log" all lowercase?
2. **Check Quotes:** are there only quotes at the beginning and end of the phrase within System.out.println()?
3. **Check Semicolon:** is there a semicolon at the end of each System.out.println()?
