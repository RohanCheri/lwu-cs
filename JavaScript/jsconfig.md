# __JavaScript Configuration__
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)

## 1) Downloading the Atom IDE
_An __IDE__ is an application made for you to write code. We'll be using Atom._
1. Navigate to [Atom.io](https://atom.io/)
2. Press "Download"
3. After the download, open AtomSetup
    * Installation will happen automatically
    * Once installation is complete, Atom will open

Atom should look something like this:

## 2) Setting up your first project
We've done a few small things ahead of time to make it easier for you to get started.
1. Download the [Template](resources/LWU-CS%20Template.zip)
2. Unzip the template and rename it to something else
3. Right click "run.html" and open it with chrome or edge
    * All you should see is "Running Javascript..."
4. Go to Atom and close all open tabs.
5. Click _File > Open File_ in Atom. Navigate to your unzipped folder and open the "main.js" file.

Atom should look something like this:

__Congrats! You're done with setup. Sit back, relax, and let your instructor know you've finished.__
