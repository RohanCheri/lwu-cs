# __Module 2: `Console.log()`__
#### [&larr; Back](README.md)

## 1) What is Console.log()
* Console.log() is a piece of code that puts text on the browser console
* The console can be accessed by pressent `CTRL + SHIFT + J` or `CMD + SHIFT + J` depending on your operating system.
* Within the parentheses of Console.log() you can put text surrounded by quotes ("")

Example
```Javascript
Console.log("Hello World");
```
Things to note:
* "Console" always has a capital "C", but "log" is all lowercase
* Any text is always surrounded by quotes
	* Single ('') and double ("") quotes both work, but in this course we will only use double ("") quotes
* **The code requires a semicolon (;) at the end of each statement to function properly**

## 2) Apply Console.log()
### Activity 1: Hello World
* Modify the template to make the console print "Hello World"
* Once you're done: Congrats! You've completed the symbolic first step of learning to code!

### Activity 2: Name and Favorite Activity
* Use two "Console.log()" statements to write your name and your favorite activity
* Once you're done: This is the end of module 2. Follow the instructions given by your instructor for what to do next.

# Debugging
When your code doesn't work, you need to debug (pronounced de-bug) it! Follow the steps below to catch common mistakes
1. **Check Capitalization:** is "Console" capitalized? Is "log" all lowercase?
2. **Check Quotes:** are there only quotes at the beginning and end of the phrase within Console.log()?
3. **Check Semicolon:** is there a semicolon at the end of each Console.log()?
